Agentic AI: Personal Career Representative Chatbot
This project is a lightweight agent-style chatbot designed to act as my personal career assistant. It uses an LLM (GPT-4o-mini via the OpenAI SDK), Gradio for the frontend, and integrates tool-calling for logging contact interest and unanswered questions. The goal is to simulate real-time, professional conversations while representing my background and experience.

Overview:
The chatbot acts as a digital representative of me (Thomas Walciszewski), answering questions related to my career, qualifications, and work history. If the user asks something outside the chatbotâ€™s scope, it logs the unknown question. If a user seems interested in further contact, it records their name, email, and any notes. I receive these events through Pushover notifications in real time.

1) The agent is built using:

	1. The OpenAI SDK (openai>=1.0) with Python

	2. GPT-4o-mini model with function calling for tools

	3. async-style control loop for handling multi-step interactions

	4. Gradio's ChatInterface() for the frontend, supporting local and public access links

2) Key Features:
	1. Agent behavior is driven by a structured system prompt simulating me

	2. Reads and uses text from a PDF (LinkedIn export) and a text-based career summary

	3. Uses function calling to:

		a. Record email/contact details

		b. Log unknown or unhandled questions

	4. Runs in a Gradio interface that launches both locally and via a public shareable URL (using Yield keyword in Python code for the gradio UI progressive streaming experience)

	5. Handles tool calls inside a controlled message-processing loop

	6. Uses .env for managing sensitive data (OpenAI key, Pushover credentials)

	7. Can be extended to support additional tools, knowledge sources, or channels
