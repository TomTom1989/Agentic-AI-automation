# Agentic AI & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of advanced AI, agentic, and machine learning projects. This workspace demonstrates deep expertise in building multi-agent systems, LLM-powered automation, and end-to-end ML pipelines. Each project showcases high-level skills in orchestration, tool integration, and real-world problem solving with state-of-the-art AI.



## üöÄ Technical Highlights & Expertise

- **Transformers & LLMs:** Deep understanding of transformer architectures, prompt engineering, and the full lifecycle of LLMs‚Äîfrom zero-shot inference to parameter-efficient finetuning (QLoRA, LoRA, quantization) and custom evaluation.
- **Finetuning & Inference:** Hands-on experience with finetuning open-source models (e.g., Falcon-RW-1B) using QLoRA and running efficient inference on quantized models, both locally and on cloud platforms (Google Colab, Hugging Face Hub).
- **Agentic AI Concepts:** Expert in designing, orchestrating, and deploying agentic AI systems. Projects demonstrate mastery of agent-as-tool, tool orchestration, agent handoff, memory, and self-evaluation loops.
- **Open-Source Frameworks:** Extensive use of open-source CrewAI and LangGraph for building modular, extensible agentic workflows‚Äîno reliance on proprietary/closed-source orchestration.
- **Multi-Platform AI Architecture:** Proven ability to build, train, and deploy AI systems across diverse environments, including local machines, Google Colab, and Hugging Face platform.


## PROJECTS:

### **CrewAI Projects**
- **[AI Debate Crew](CrewAI%20projects/ai_debate/README.md):**  
  Multi-agent debate system where two LLM agents argue for/against a motion and a judge agent decides the winner. YAML-driven, highly modular, and demonstrates sequential agent orchestration.
- **[Stock Picker AI Crew](CrewAI%20projects/stock_picker/README.md):**  
  Automated financial news analysis, company research, and stock selection using a pipeline of specialized agents.
- **[Engineering Team Crew](CrewAI%20projects/engineering_team/README.md):**  
  Simulates a full software engineering team (lead, backend, test, frontend) to generate code, tests, and UI from requirements.
- **[Financial Researcher Crew](CrewAI%20projects/financial_researcher/README.md):**  
  End-to-end financial research and report generation with role-specialized agents.

### **LangGraph Sidekick**
- **[LangGraph Agentic Assistant](Langraph/README.md):**  
  Advanced agentic assistant using LangGraph and LangChain. Supports tool use (web, Python REPL, file ops), self-evaluation, and iterative refinement. Features a Gradio UI and persistent memory.

### **OpenAI SDK Agentic Apps**
- **[Personal Career Agent](Project%20personal%20career%20agent%20project%20(openai%20sdk)/README.md):**  
  LLM-powered chatbot that acts as a personal career representative, with tool-calling for contact logging and unknown question handling. Real-time notifications and PDF/text knowledge integration.
- **[Cold Email Automation Agent](Project%20AI%20agent%20cold%20email%20automation%20(openai%20sdk)/README.md):**  
  Multi-agent workflow for generating, validating, and sending cold sales emails. Features agent-as-tool, input guardrails, and trace-based debugging.

### **Deep Research AI Agent**
- **[Research Crew (OpenAI Agent SDK)](Deep%20Research%20AI%20Agent%20(openai%20agent%20sdk)/README.md):**  
  Modular research agent system for producing comprehensive reports, with planner, writer, and search agents.
