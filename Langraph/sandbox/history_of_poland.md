# History of Poland

## Overview
The history of Poland spans over a thousand years, from medieval tribes, Christianization, and monarchy; through Poland's Golden Age, expansionism, and becoming one of the largest European powers; to its collapse and partitions, two world wars, communism, and the restoration of democracy.

## Early History
- The roots of Polish history can be traced to ancient times, with diverse ethnic groups inhabiting the territory, including Celts, Scythians, Sarmatians, Slavs, Balts, and Germanic peoples.
- The West Slavic Lechites, ancestors of ethnic Poles, established permanent settlements during the Early Middle Ages.
- The first ruling dynasty, the Piasts, emerged in the 10th century AD, with Duke Mieszko I adopting Western Christianity in 966 CE.

## Kingdom of Poland
- Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a medieval kingdom in 1025 by his son Bolesław I the Brave.
- Bolesław I is known for his military expansions, while Casimir III the Great presided over economic prosperity before his death in 1370 without male heirs.

## Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
- The Jagiellonian dynasty (14th–16th centuries) brought territorial expansion and cultural Renaissance, culminating in the establishment of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569.
- The Commonwealth was one of Europe's great powers, maintaining a unique noble democracy with an elective monarchy.

## Decline and Partition
- From the mid-17th century, the Commonwealth entered a period of decline due to wars and political system deterioration.
- Significant internal reforms occurred, including Europe's first Constitution of 3 May 1791.
- The Commonwealth ended in 1795 after partitions by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg monarchy.

## 20th Century
- The Second Polish Republic was established in 1918 but was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, marking the beginning of World War II.
- Millions perished under Nazi occupation between 1939 and 1945, with a Polish government-in-exile functioning throughout the war.
- After World War II, Poland became a satellite communist country, the Polish People's Republic, with significant territorial adjustments. 

## Modern Poland
- The late 1980s saw the Polish reform movement Solidarity contribute to a peaceful transition from communism to capitalism and democracy.
- This process led to the establishment of the modern Polish state, the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.
